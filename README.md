# 🩺 Diabetic Detection Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to detect diabetes based on patient data and early signs of diabetic retinopathy. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation using classification metrics.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- (Optional) OpenCV or image-based analysis (for Retinopathy)

## 📁 Project Files
- `dd.ipynb`: Diabetic detection using clinical/health data
- `Retinopathy_detection.ipynb`: Detection of diabetic retinopathy (likely image or vision-based approach)

## 🧠 Key Steps
1. Data loading and cleaning (handling nulls, normalizing values)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature selection and model building (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
4. Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
5. (If image-based): Image preprocessing and retina-based classification

## 📈 Results
- Achieved high accuracy in detecting diabetic patients using ML models
- Visualized feature importance and disease distribution

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open notebooks:
   - `dd.ipynb` for health data classification
   - `Retinopathy_detection.ipynb` for retinal disease detection
3. Run cells sequentially in Jupyter Notebook
